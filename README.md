#HW: Business website: Node.js
Static Website on Node.js
##Instructions
- Take the website that you built previously, and create a new branch on git so the old version is still available for grading / reviewing.
- Put your website on a Node.js server, so that it can be reached at http://localhost:3000.
- Your Node.js server does not need any routes, since the entire website is static content.
- Check each of your links and images to ensure that they still work.
- Express by default looks for `index.html` for the first page.

##Credits
